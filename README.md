This Python program is a simple command-line Blackjack game where the player competes against the computer dealer. The game deals cards, calculates scores with Ace adjustment, and lets the player choose to draw more cards or hold. It announces the winner based on traditional Blackjack rules and repeats until the player decides to quit.
